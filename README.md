# Google Agents Intensive Capstone Project

## Project Name: What's for Dinner?

This project is an attempt to create a google-adk based project
to help with preparing dinner based on the ingredients on hand and
preferred time to cook.

The user can optionally specify dietary restrictions and allergy information.

It is modelled on some of the examples at https://github.com/google/adk-samples

There is scope to add options like nutrition info, budget,
and use location info to determine proximity to cafés and restaurants to make
buy/make decisions etc.,
